**TAS500: Semantic Segmentation Dataset for Autonomous Driving in Unstructured Environments** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the automotive and robotics industries. 

The dataset consists of 640 images with 5351 labeled objects belonging to 24 different classes including *ego vehicle*, *low grass*, *forest*, and other: *sky*, *high grass*, *gravel*, *bush*, *tree trunk*, *building*, *asphalt*, *tree crown*, *pole*, *misc. object*, *fence*, *soil*, *misc. vegetation*, *car*, *wall*, *traffic sign*, *person*, *animal*, *bus*, *undefined*, and *sand*.

Images in the TAS500 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 100 (16% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (440 images), *test* (100 images), and *val* (100 images). Additionally, each label has ***supercategory*** tag. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2021 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Institute for Autonomous Systems Technology, Bundeswehr University Munich, Germany</span>.
