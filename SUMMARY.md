**TAS500: semantic segmentation dataset for autonomous driving in unstructured environments** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 640 images with 17516 labeled objects belonging to 24 different classes including *ego vehicle*, *low grass*, *forest*, and other: *sky*, *high grass*, *gravel*, *bush*, *tree trunk*, *building*, *asphalt*, *tree crown*, *pole*, *fence*, *misc. object*, *soil*, *misc. vegetation*, *car*, *wall*, *person*, *traffic sign*, *animal*, *bus*, *undefined*, and *sand*.

Images in the TAS500 dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 100 (16% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (440 images), *test* (100 images), and *val* (100 images). Additionally, each label has ***supercategory*** tag. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Institute for Autonomous Systems Technology Bundeswehr University Munich, Germany.
